# Stock Planning & Report Generator

This project focuses on generating analytical reports based on stock and planning data using Python. It is part of a hands-on lab exploring data filtering, aggregation, and reporting using Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Import and explore stock/planning datasets.
- Filter and manipulate data based on item characteristics and stock constraints.
- Generate summary tables and structured reports.
- Demonstrate data pipeline logic through code and markdown documentation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pandas**
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** *(optional)*

## 🧾 Features

- Efficient filtering of relevant stock records.
- Custom report generation with grouped summaries.
- Clean code documentation for educational or extension purposes.

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/stock-planning-report-generator.git
   ```

2. Open the notebook:
   - Upload it to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or run locally with Jupyter.

3. Install required libraries (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```

4. Run each cell to explore the data and generate reports.

## 📌 Use Cases

- Inventory forecasting and planning
- Educational demonstration for data manipulation
- Backend support for supply chain dashboards

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

This lab was completed as part of coursework in data analysis and reporting.
